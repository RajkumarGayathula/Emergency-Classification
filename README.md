🏥 Machine Learning Based Patient Classification in Emergency Department

📌 Project Overview : 
Emergency Departments (ED) face challenges in prioritizing patients efficiently due to high patient inflow and limited medical resources. This project uses Machine Learning techniques to classify patients based on the severity of their condition, enabling faster and more accurate triage decisions.
The system analyzes patient data such as vital signs and symptoms to predict priority levels, helping medical staff improve response time and patient care quality.

🎯 Objectives
Automate patient classification in emergency departments
Reduce waiting time for critical patients
Improve decision-making using machine learning models
Enhance efficiency in hospital resource allocation

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks:
  NumPy
  Pandas
  Scikit-learn
  Matplotlib
  Seaborn
IDE/Tools: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

📊 Dataset
Patient data including vital signs, symptoms, and clinical indicators
Dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and noise
Used for supervised machine learning classification
