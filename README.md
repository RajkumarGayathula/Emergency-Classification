🏥 Machine Learning Based Patient Classification in Emergency Department


# 📌 Project Overview : 

   1. Emergency Departments (ED) face challenges in prioritizing patients efficiently due to high patient inflow and limited medical resources. This project uses Machine Learning techniques to classify patients         based   on the severity of their condition, enabling faster and more accurate triage decisions.
   2. The system analyzes patient data such as vital signs and symptoms to predict priority levels, helping medical staff improve response time and patient care quality.


# 🎯 Objectives :

   1. Automate patient classification in emergency departments.
   2. Reduce waiting time for critical patients.
   3. Improve decision-making using machine learning models.
   4. Enhance efficiency in hospital resource allocation.


# 🛠️ Technologies Used : 

    1. Programming Language: Python.
    2. Libraries & Frameworks:
        NumPy,
        Pandas,
        Scikit-learn,
        Matplotlib
        Seaborn.
    3. IDE/Tools: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code.


# 📊 Dataset : 

   1. Patient data including vital signs, symptoms, and clinical indicators.
   2. Dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and noise.
   3. Used for supervised machine learning classification.
